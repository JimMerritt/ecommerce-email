# e-commerce email

This is a testing area for building an interactive e-commerce email that will allow a user to shop directly from an email. This concept is pulled from [Mark Robbin's](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/10/punched-card-coding-the-secret-of-interactive-email/) article on interactive email capabilities.

## To Begin

1. We are building the email with an external stylesheet to get the proof of concept rolling
